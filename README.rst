Project archived. No maintenance anymore.
=========================================

This project is not maintained anymore and is archived. All the current Open-Needs IDE language features
are moved into `Sphinx-Needs <https://github.com/useblocks/sphinxcontrib-needs>`_. The features will be
automatically detected and integrated into `Esbonio language server <https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio>`_.

Since Vscode extension `reStructuredText <https://github.com/vscode-restructuredtext/vscode-restructuredtext>`_
supports Esbonio, so all the Open-Needs IDE features will be available automatically, so no additional Vscode
extesnion is needed anymore. Therefore, Open-Needs IDE is shutdown.

Thanks to everyone for their interests and contributions.
