Auto-generated need IDs
-----------------------

   :align: center

Type ``:`` in the line directly below a need directive like ``.. req::`` and select ``:id:`` in the IntelliSense interface.


.. hint::

   * If needls can't detect the type of the need it will just output `ID`.
   * The ID is calculated using a hash function of the current user, doc URI, line number and the need prefix (e.g.).
     To lower the risk of ID conflicts further a pseudo-randomization is part of the ID generation.s
